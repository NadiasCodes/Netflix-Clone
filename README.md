<h1 align="center" id="title">Netflix Clone</h1>



<p id="description">This is my very first attempt to create a Netflix clone using fetch API. This is a complicated project, with a backend that I cannot provide.
It's a work in progress, but this is a very first glimpse. </p>

<h2>👁‍🗨 Functions</h2>
The user is able to click on any video and display the trailer and go back to the homepage.
- I have created a login page but sadly it is not functional at this early stage.
The backend is yet to be added, but it will be long-term. Right now I am focusing only on front-end.

#funfact: I could not name this project "Netflix Clone" because my browser was detecting it as a malicious, phishing website and I was being denied access, lol
